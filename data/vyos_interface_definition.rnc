# Interface definition starts with nodeList tag that may contain node tags
start = element nodeList { node* }

# node tag may contain node, leafNode, or tagNode tags
# Those are intermediate configuration nodes that may only contain
# other nodes and must not have values
node = element node { nodeNameAttr, (node | tagNode | leafNode)+ }

# All nodes must have "name" attribute
nodeNameAttr = attribute name { text }

# Tag nodes are containers for nodes without predefined names, like network interfaces
# or user names (e.g. "interfaces ethernet eth0" or "user jrandomhacker")
# Tag nodes may	contain	node and leafNode elements, and also nameConstraint tags
# They must not contain other tag nodes
tagNode = element tagNode { nodeNameAttr, nameConstraint?, helpString?, (node | leafNode)+ }

# Tag nodes may also contain nameConstraint tag with type and constraint
# attributes. It provides information required to validate child name.
nameConstraint = element nameConstraint { typeAttr, constraintAttr, empty }

# Leaf nodes are terminal configuration nodes that can't have children,
# but can have values.
# Leaf node may contain one or more valueConstraint tags
# If multiple valueConstraint tags are used, they work a logical OR
leafNode = element leafNode { nodeNameAttr, helpString?, (valueHelpString | valueConstraint)* }

# valueConstraint tag contains information required to validate node values
# It must have two attributes, "type" and "constraint".
valueConstraint = element valueConstraint { typeAttr, constraintAttr, empty }

# helpString tag contains brief description of the purpose of the node
# Must have description= attribute
helpString = element helpString { descriptionAttr, empty }

# valueHelpString tag contain information about acceptable value format
# It may be exact value in value= attribute, or a placeholder taken from
# type specified in type= attribute
valueHelpString = element valueHelpString { (valueAttr | typeAttr), descriptionAttr, empty }

# description= attribute contains help strings for nodes
descriptionAttr = attribute description { text }

# value= attributes contains one of allowed values for leaf nodes

# type= attribute is used in leaf nodes and contains name of a type
# to take value placeholder from
typeAttr = attribute type { text }

# constraint= attribute contains additional information for type validation,
# used in valueContrating tags
constraintAttr = attribute constraint { text }
